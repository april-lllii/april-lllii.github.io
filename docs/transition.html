                This project is about showcasing the process of transition through videos. In this project, I learned more about how to transition between graphics, and how to match sound with visuals for transitional effects.

                In the final outcome, what I wanted to embody more in the voiceover aspect was my disorganized morning: very eager to get ready to go out and prepare breakfast.
                <div class="pb-10"></div>
                Since drinking coffee is an essential step for me every morning, the coffee element is the most important one -  the coffee machine, the pouring of coffee beans, as well as the sounds of washing the cups and tearing open the bread packaging are mixed in.

                In the animation part, the first half of the irregular shapes and the granular texture effects represent the rough part, which is also the most sleepy and busy phase when I just wake up. The second half of the circle represents the smooth, with the added sound of drinking coffee, which represents the end of my panicked morning with a cup of coffee, so I can leave for school on time.
